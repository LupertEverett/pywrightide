# PyWright IDE: A simple IDE for working on PyWright games.

This project is a simple IDE written in Python and PyQt, that aims to make developing PyWright games easier. It features a tabbed text editor with syntax highlighting, dialogs to create new or interact with games/cases, and asset browsers.

## Dependencies

* A recent Python version (3.10+)
* PyQt6 and PyQt6-QScintilla
* pygame (only for playing sounds)

> [!NOTE]
> To easily install the dependencies, run this command below on the folder PyWright IDE is in:
> 
> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

For the source code version: Have all the dependencies installed, and then run PyWrightIDE.py

A compiled build for Windows is also available. Just download, extract and run PyWrightIDE.exe

## Building for Windows

Alongside the dependencies above, have `pyinstaller` installed via pip. Then run this command in the source code's root folder:
